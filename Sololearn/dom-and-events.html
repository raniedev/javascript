            [DOM & Events]
            What's Dom?
                When you open any webpage in a browser, the HTML of the page is loaded and rendered visually on the screen. To accomplish that,
            the browser builds the Document Object Model of that page, which is an object oriented model of its logical structure. The DOM of an
            HTML document can be represented as a nested set of boxes:
                        
                             DOCUMENT
                                ║
                    ╔═════════<html>════════╗
                    ║                       ║
                 <head>                   <body>
                    ║                ╔══════╩════════╗
                 <title>             ║               ║
                                    <h1>            <a>

            Javascript can be used to manipulate the DOM of a page dynamically to add, delete and modify elements.

            DOM Tree
            The DOM represents a document as a tree structure.
            HTML elements become interrelated nodes in the tree. All those nodes in the tree have some kind of relations among each other.
            Nodes can have child nodes. Nodes on the same tree level are called siblings. For example, consider the following structure above.
            
            
            For the example above:
            <html> has two children(<head>, <body>);
            <head> has one child(title) and one parent(<html>);
            <title> has one parent(<head>) and no children;
            <body> has two children(<h1> and <a>) and one parent(<html>);
                
            It's important to understand the relationships between elements in an HTML document in order to be able to manipulate them with Javascript.

            
            The Document Object
                There's a predefined document object in Javascript, which can be used to access all elements on the DOM. In other words, the document
            object is the owner(or root) of all objects in your webpage. So, if you want to access objects in an HTML page, you always start with accessing
            the document object.
            For example:
                document.body.innerHTML = "Some text";
            
            As body is an element of the DOM, we can access it using the document object and change the content of the innerHTML property.

            The innerHTML property can be used on almost all HTML elements to change its content.

            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            [SELECT ELEMENTS]
            Selecting elements
                All HTML elements are objects. And as we know every object has properties and methods. The document object has methods that allow
            you to select the desired HTML element. These three methods are the most commonly used for selecting HTML elements:
            
                • finds element by id
                document.getElementById(id)

                • finds elements by class name
                document.getElementByClassName(name)

                • finds elements by tag name 
                document.getElementByTagName(name)

            In the example below, the getElementById method is used to select the element with id="demo" and change its content:
            */
            var elem = document.getElementById("demo");
            elem.innerHTML = "Hello World!";

            /*
            The getElementsByClassName() method finds all elements by class name and returns them as an array. For example, if our HTML
            page contained three elements with class='demo', the following code would return all those elements as an array:
            */
            //var arr = document.getElementByClassName('demo');
            //arr[1].innerHTML = "Hi";

            /*
            Similarly, the getElementsByTagName method returns all of the elements of the specified tag name as an array. The following example
            gets all paragraph elements of the page and changes their content:
            
            <p>hi</p>
            <p>hello</p>
            <p>hi</p>
            
            var arr = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
            for (var x = 0; x < arr.length; x++) {
                arr[x].innerHTML = "Hi there";
            }
            */
            var arr2 = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
            for(var x = 0; x < arr2.length; x++){
                arr2[x].innerHTML = "Hi there";
            }
            /*We used the length property of the array to loop through all the selected elements in the above example.

            
            Working with DOM
            Each element in the DOM has a set of properties and methods that provide information about their relationships in the DOM:
            element.childNodes returns an array of an element's child nodes.
            element.firstChild returns the first child node of an element.
            element.lastChild returns the last child node of an element.
            element.hasChildNodes returns true if an element has any child nodes, otherwise false.
            element.nextSibling returns the next node at the same tree level.
            element.previousSibling returns the previous node at the same tree level
            element.parentNode returns the parent node of an element.

            We can, for example, select all child nodes of an element and change their content:
            */
        </script>
        <div id="demo3">
            <p>some text</p>
            <p>some other text</p>
        </div>
        <script>
            function setText(){
                var a = document.getElementById("demo3");
                var arr3 = a.childNodes;
                for(var x = 0; arr3.length; x++){
                    arr3[x].innerHTML = "new text";
                }
                //the code above changes the text of both paragraphs to "new text".
            }
            setTimeout(setText, 3000);

            /*

            [CHANGING ATTRIBUTES]
            Once you have selected the element(s) you want to work with, you can change their attributes. As we have seen in the previous
            lessons, we can change the text content of an element using the innerHTML property.

            Similary, we can change the attributes of elements. For example, we can change the src attribute of an image:            
            */
        </script>
        
        <a href="http://www.example.com">Some Link</a><br/><br/>
        <img id="myimg" src="orange.jpg" alt=""/>

        <script>
            var el = document.getElementById("myimg");
            el.src = "apple.jpg";

            //We can change the href attribute of a link:
            
            var el = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
            el[0].href = "http://www.youtube.com";

            //Practically all attributes of an element can be changed using Javascript


            /*
            Changing Style
            
            The Style of HTML elements can also be changed using Javascript. All style attributes can be accessed using the style
            object of the element.

            For example:
            */
        </script>

        <div id="demo4" style="color: darkgreen"><br/>Google</div>

        <script>
            var x = document.getElementById("demo4");
            x.style.color = "#6600FF";
            x.style["font-size"] = "15px";
            x.style.fontSize = "25px";
            /*The text above changes the text color of the div element

            All CSS properties can be set and modified using Javascript. Just remember, that you cannot use dashes (-) in the property
            names: these are replaced with camelCase versions, where the compound words begin with a capital letter.

            For example: the background-color property should be referred to as .backgroundColor or ["background-color"]

            
            [ADDING AND REMOVING ELEMENTS]
            Creating Elements
                Use the following methods to create new nodes:
                    element.cloneNode() clones an element and returns the resulting node.
                    document.createElement(element) creates a new element node.
                    document.createTextNode(text) creates a new text node.
            For example:
                var node = document.createTextNode("Some new text");

            This will create a new text node, but it will not appear in the document until you append it to an existing element with one
            of the following methods:
                element.appendChild(newNode) adds a new child node to an element as the last child node.
                element.insertBefore(node1, node2) inserts node1 as a child before node2.
            
            Example:
            */
        </script>   
        
        <div id="demo5">
                
        </div>

        <script>
            var p = document.createElement("p");
            var node = document.createTextNode("Adding this text through Javascript code.");
            p.appendChild(node);
            
            var h1 = document.createElement("h1");
            var node1 = document.createTextNode("Title added by JS");
            h1.appendChild(node1);

            var div = document.getElementById("demo5");
            div.appendChild(h1);
            div.appendChild(p);

            /*
            Removing Elements
                To remove an HTML element, you must select the parent of the element and use the removeChild(node) method.
            For example:
            */
        </script>

        <div id="demo6">
            <p id="p1">This is a paragraph.</p>
            <p id="p2">This is another  paragraph.</p>
        </div>

        <script>
            var parent = document.getElementById("demo6");
            var child = document.getElementById("p1");
            parent.removeChild(child);

            /*
            This remove the paragraph with id="p1" from the page

            An alternative way of achieving the same result would be the use of the parentNode property to get the parent of the element
            we want to remove:
                var child = document.getElementById("p1");
                child.parentNode.removeChild(child);

        
            Replacing Elements
            To replace an HTML element, the element replaceChild(newNode, oldNode) method is used.
            For example:
            */
        </script>

        <div id="demo7">
            <p id="p4">2 - This is a paragraph.</p>
            <p id="p5">2 - This is another paragraph.</p>
        </div>

        <script>
            var p3 = document.createElement("p");
            var node3 = document.createTextNode("Replacing this text");
            p3.appendChild(node3);

            var parent = document.getElementById("demo7");
            var child = document.getElementById("p4");
            parent.replaceChild(p3, child);

            /*
            The code above creates a new paragraph element that replaces the existing p4 paragraph.


            [CREATING ANIMATIONS]

            Animations 
                Now that we know how to select and change DOM elements, we can create a simple animation. Let's create a simple
            HTML page with a box element that will be animated using JS.
            */
        </script>
        

        <div id="container">
            <div id="box"></div>
        </div>

        <!--
            Our box element is inside a container element. Note the position attribute used for the elements: the container is relative
        and the box is absolute. This will allow us to create the animation relative to the container.

        We will be animating the red box to make it move to the right side of the container.


        Animations
            To create an animation, we need to change the properties of an element at small intervals of time. We can achieve this by using
        the setInterval() method, which allows us to create a timer and call a function to change properties repeatedly at defined intervals
        (in milliseconds).

        For example:
            var t = setInterval(move, 500);
        
        This code creates a timer that calls a move() function every 500 milliseconds. Now we need to define the move() function, that changes
        the position of the box.
        -->

        <script>
            //starting position
            var pos = 0;
            //our box element
            var box = document.getElementById("box");
    
            /*function move(){
                pos += 50;
                box.style.left = pos + "px"; 
            }
            //The move() function increments the left property of the box element by one each time it is called.
            move();*/

            /*
            Animations

            The following code defines a timer that calls the move() function every 10miliseconds:
            */
            var t = setInterval(move, 10);
            /*
            However, this makes our box move to the right forever. To stop the animation when the box reaches the end of the container, we add
            a simple check to the move() function and use the clearInterval() method to stop the timer.
            */
            function move(){
                if(pos>=150){
                    clearInterval(t);
                }else{
                    pos += 1;
                    box.style.left = pos + "px";
                }
            }
            /*
            When the left attribute of the box reaches the value of 150, the box reaches the end of the container, based on a container width of 200
            and a box width of 50.
            
            The final code:

                var pos = 0; 
                //our box element
                var box = document.getElementById("box");
                var t = setInterval(move, 10);

                function move() {
                    if(pos >= 150) {
                        clearInterval(t);
                    }
                    else {
                        pos += 1;
                        box.style.left = pos+"px";
                    }
                }
            

            [HANDING EVENTS]
            
            Events
                You can write Javascript code that executes when an event occurs, such as when a user clicks an HTML element, moves the mouse,
            or submits a form.
                When an event occurs on a target element, a handler function is executed.
            
            Common HTML events include:

            EVENT                   DESCRIPTION
            onclick                 occurs when the user clicks on an element
            onload                  occurs when an object has loaded
            onunload                occurs once a page has unloaded (for <body>)
            onchange                occurs when the content of a form element, the selection, or the checked state have changed
                                    (for <input>, <keygen>, <select>, and <textarea>)
            onmouseover             occurs when the pointer is moved onto an element, or onto one of its children
            onmouseout              occurs when a user moves the mouse pointer out of an element, or out of one of its children
            onmousedown             occurs when the user presses a mouse button over an element
            onmouseup               occurs when a user releases a mouse button over an element
            onblur                  occurs when an element loses focus
            onfocus                 occurs when an element gets focus

            Corresponding events can be added to HTML elements as attributes.
            For example:
                <p onclick="someFunc()">Some text</p>

            
            Handling Events
            Let's display an alert popup when the user clicks a specified button:
            */
        </script>

        <br/><button onclick="show()">Onclick Event</button>
        <br/><br/><button id="demo8" onclick="show()">Show Date/Time</button>

        <script>
            function show(){
                alert("Button clicked!");

            Event handlers can be assigned to elements.
            For example:
            */
            var x = document.getElementById("demo8");
            x.onclick = function(){
                document.body.innerHTML = Date();
            }

            Events
                The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page. These can be useful when performing
            actions after the page is loaded.

            <body onload="doSomething()">

            Similarly, the window.onload event can be used to run code after the whole page is loaded.

            window.onload = function(){
                //some code
            }
            
            The onchange event is mostly used on textboxes. The event handler gets called when the text inside the textbox changes and focus
            is lost from the element.
            For example:
            */
        </script>
        
        <br/><br/><input type="text" id="name" onchange="change()">

        <script>
            function change(){
                var x = document.getElementById("name");
                x.value = x.value.toUpperCase();
            }

            /*
            Events Listeners
                The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers. You can
            add many event handlers to one element.
                You can also add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e., two "click" events.
                    element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
            
            The first parameter is the event's type(like "click" or "mousedown").
            The second parameter is the function we want to call when the event occurs.
            The third parameter is a Boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing. This parameter is optional, and
            will be described in the next lesson.

                Note that you don't use the "on" prefix for this event; use "click" instead of "onclick"
            
            Example:
            */
        </script>

        <br/><br/><button id="demo9">Start</button>

        <script>
            var btn = document.getElementById("demo9");
            btn.addEventListener("click", myFunction);
            //element.addEventListener("mouseover", myFunction);

            function myFunction(){
                alert(Math.random());
                btn.removeEventListener("click", myFunction);
            }
            
            /*
            After clicking the button, an alert with a random number displays and the event listener is removed.

            Internet Explorer version 8 and lower do not support the addEventListener() and removeEventListener() methods. However, you
            can use the document.attachEvent() method to attach event handlers in Internet Explorer.


            [EVENT PROPAGATION]
            Event progagation
                There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM: bubbling and capturing.

                Event propagation allows for the definition of the element order when an event occurs. If you have a <p> element inside
            a <div> element, and the user clicks on the <p> element, which element's "click" event should be handled first?

                In bubbling, the innermost element's event ins handled first and then the outer element's event is handled. The <p> element's
            click event is handled first, followed by the <div> element's click event. 

                In capturing, the outermost element's event is handled first and then the inner. The <div> element's click event is handled
            first, followed by the <p> element's click event.

                Capturing goes down the DOM.
                Bubbling goes up the DOM.

            
            Capturing Vs Bubbling
            
            The addEventListener() method allows you to specify the propagation type with the "useCapture" parameter.

                addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)

            The default value is false, which means the bubbling propagation is used; when the value is set to true, the event uses
            the capturing propagation
            
                capturing propagation
                elem1.addEventListener("click", myFunction, true);

                bubbling propagation
                elem2.addEventListener("click", myFunction, false);
            
            This is particularly useful when you have the same event handled for multiple elements in the DOM hierarchy.


            [IMAGE SLIDER]
            Now we can create a sample image slider project. The images will be changed using "Next" and "Prev" buttons.
            Now, let's create our HTML, which includes an image and the two navigations buttons:
            */
        </script>
        
        <div>
            <br/><br/>
            <button onclick="prev()">Prev</button>
            <img id="slider" src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/1.jpg" width="200px" height="100px"/>
            <button onclick="next()">Next</button>
        </div>

        <script>
            var images = [
                "http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/1.jpg", 
                "http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/2.jpg", 
                "http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/3.jpg"
            ];
            /*
            We are going to use three sample images that we have uploaded to our server. You can use any number of images.


            Image Slider

            Now we need to handle the Next nad Prev button clicks and call the corresponding functions to change the image.
                <div>
                    <button onclick="prev()"> Prev </button>
                    <img id="slider" src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/1.jpg" 
                        width="200px" height="100px"/>
                    <button onclick="next()"> Next </button>
                </div>
            */

            var num = 0;
            
            function next(){
                var slider = document.getElementById("slider");
                num++;
                if(num>=images.length){
                    num = 0;
                }
                slider.src = images[num];
            }

            function prev(){
                var slider = document.getElementById("slider");
                num--;
                if(num < 0){
                    num = images.length - 1;
                }
                slider.src = images[num];
            }

            /*
            The num variable holds the current image. The next and previous button clicks are handled by their corresponding functions,
            which change the source of the image to the next/previous image in the array.

            We have created a functioning image slider!

            
            Form validation

                HTML5 adds some attributes that allow form validation. For example, the required attributes can be added to an input field to make
            it mandatory to fill in.
                More complex form validation can be done using Javascript.
                The form element has an onsubmit event that can be handled to perfom validation. For example, let's create a form with two inputs
            and one button. The text in both fields should be the same and not blank to pass the validation.
            */
        </script>

        <form onsubmit="return validate()" method="post"><br/>
            Number: <input type="text" name="num1" id="num1"/><br/>
            Repeat: <input type="text" name="num2" id="num2"/><br/>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
        </form>    
        
        <script>
            /*
            Now we need to define the validate() function:
            */
            function validate(){
                var n1 = document.getElementById("num1");
                var n2 = document.getElementById("num2");
                if(n1.value != "" && n2.value != ""){
                    if(n1.value == n2.value){
                        return true;
                    }
                }
                alert("The values should be equal and not blank");
                return false;
            }
            /*
            We return true only when the values are not blank and are equal.

            The form will not get submitted if its onsubmit event returns false.
