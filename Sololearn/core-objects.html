            [CORE OBJECTS]
            Javascript arrays

            Array store multiple values in a single variable.

            To store three course names, you need three variables.

            var course1 = 'HTML';
            var course2 = 'CSS';
            var course3 = 'JS';

            But what if you had 500 courses? The solution is an array.
            */
            var courses = new Array('HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'SQL');
            //The syntax declares an array named courses, which stores three values, or elements.

            /*
            Acessing a array
                You refer to an array element by referring to the index number written in square brackets. This statement
                accesses the value of the first element in courses and changes the value of the second element.
            */
            document.write("The second course in the array list is: " + courses[1]);
            courses[1] = 'C++'; //[0] is the first element in an array. [1] is the second, and so on. Array indexes start with 0.
            document.write("<br/>Course in second position updated. The current second course now is: " + courses[1]);
            
            /*
            Attempting to acess an index outside of the array, returns the value undefined.
            
            Our courses array has just 3 elements, so the 9th index, which is the 10th element, does not exist (is undefined) 
            */
            document.write("<br/>Searching a value out of maximum range... The 10th value doesn't exit, your value is: " + courses[9]);
            
            /*
            [OTHER WAYS TO CREATE ARRAYS]
            You can also declare an array, tell in the number of elements it will store, and add the elements later.*/

            var courses2 = new Array(3);
            courses2[0] = 'Java';
            courses2[1] = 'PHP';
            courses2[2] = 'Python';

            /*An array is a special type of object. An array uses numbers to access its elements, and an object uses names 
            to access its numbers
            
            Javacript arrays are dynamic, so you can declare an array and not pass any arguments with the Array() constructor.
            You can then add the elements dynamically.
            */
            var courses3 = new Array();
            courses3[0] = 'Swift';
            courses3[1] = 'Angular';
            courses3[2] = 'J-Query';
            courses3[3] = 'C#'; 
            courses3[4] = 'Lua';//You can add as many elements are you need to.

            /*
            Array Literal
                For greater simplicity, readability, and execution speed, you can also declare arrays using the array literal syntax.
            */
            var courses4 = ['C', 'Cobol', 'Lisp', 'Fortran', 'Asp', 'Ruby on Rails'];

            /*
            This results in the same array as the one created with the new Array() syntax.

            You can access and modify the elements of the array using the index number, as you did before. The array literal syntax is the
            recommended way to declare arrays.

            [ARRAY PROPERTIES AND METHODS]
            Javacript arrays have useful built-in properties and methods.
            An array's length property returns the number of it's elements.
            */
            document.write("<br/>The first array has " + courses.length + " elements.");
            document.write("<br/>The second array has " + courses2.length + " elements.");
            document.write("<br/>The third array has " + courses3.length + " elements.");
            document.write("<br/>The fourth array has " + courses4.length + " elements.");
            /*The length property is always one more than the highest array index. If the array is empty, the length property returns 0.

            Combining Arrays
            Javascript's concat() method allows you to join arrays and create an entirely new array.
            
            Example:
            */
            var courses5 = courses.concat(courses2); //The concat method takes two arrays and combines them in a new one array.
            document.write("<br/>The new array called courses5 has the following elements below: ");
            for(loop = 0; loop < courses5.length; loop++){
                document.write("<br/>" + courses5[loop]);
            }
            /*
            The courses5 array that results contains 7 elements ('HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'SQL') from courses array and ('Java', 'PHP',
            'Python') from courses2 array.
            
            The concat operation does not affect the arrays in process. It returns the resulting concatenation as a new array.
            
            
            Associative Arrays
                While many programming languages support arrays with named indexes(text instead of numbers), called associative arrays,
            Javascript does not. However, you still can use the named array syntax, which will produce an object.
            
            For example:
            */
            var person = []; //empty array
            person['name'] = 'Helen';
            person['age'] = 55;
            document.write("<br/>" + person['age']);

            /*
            Now, person is treated as an object, instead of being an array. The named indexes 'name' and 'age' become properties
            of the person object.

            As the person array is treated as an object, the standard array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.
            For example, person.length will return 0.

            
            Remember that Javascript does not support arrays with named indexes. In Javascript, arrays always use numbered indexes.
            It's better to use an object when you want the index to be a string(text). Use an array when you want the index to be a number.

            If you use a named index, Javascript will redefine the array to a standard object.

            
            [THE MATH OBJECT]
            The Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks, and includes several properties.

            PROPERTY                DESCRIPTION
            E                       Euler's constant
            LN2                     Natural log of the value 2
            LN10                    Natural log of the value 10
            LOG2E                   The base 2 log of Euler's constant(E)
            LOG10E                  The base 10 log of Euler's constant(E)
            PI                      Returns the constant PI

            For example:
            */
            document.write("<br/>PI value: " + Math.PI);
            /*
            Math has no constructor. There's no need to create a Math object first.

            The Object Methods
                The Math object contains a number of methods that are used for calculations:
            
            METHOD                  DESCRIPTION
            abs(x)                  Returns the absolute value of x
            acos(x)                 Returns the arccosine of x, in radians
            asin(x)                 Returns the arcsine of x, in radians
            atan(x)                 Returns the arctangent of x as a numeric value between -PI/2 and PI/2 radians
            atan2(x, y)             Returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments
            ceil(x)                 Returns x, rounded upwards to the nearest integer
            cos(x)                  Returns the cosine of x (x is in radians)
            exp(x)                  Returns the value of E*
            floor(x)                Returns x, rounded downwards to the nearest integer
            log(x)                  Returns the natural logarithm (base E) of x
            max(x,y,z,...,n)        Returns the number with the highest value
            min(x,y,z,...,n)        Returns the number with the lowest value
            pow(x,y)                Returns the value of x to the power of y
            random()                Returns a random number between 0 and 1
            round(x)                Rounds x to the nearest integer
            sin(x)                  Returns the sine of x (x is in radians)
            sqrt(x)                 Returns the square root of x
            tan(x)                  Returns the tangent of an angle
            
            For example, the following will calculate the square root of a number.
            */
            var number = Math.sqrt(4);
            document.write("<br/>What's the square root of 4? Answer:" + number);

            /*
            The Math Object
                Let's create a program that will ask the user to input a number and alert its square root.
            
            var number2 = prompt("Enter a number", "");
            var answer = Math.sqrt(number2);
            alert("The square root of " + number2 + " is " + answer);*/

            /*
            The Date Object
            setInterval
                the setInterval() method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals
            (in milliseconds). It will continue calling the function until clearInterval() is called or the window is closed.

            For example:
            
            function myAlert(){
                alert("Hi");
            }
            setInterval(myAlert, 3000);*/

            /*
            This will call the myAlert function every 3 seconds (1000ms = 1 second)

            Write the name of the function without parentheses when passing it into the setInterval method.
            
            
            The date object enables us to work with dates. A date consists of a year, a month, a day, an hour, a minute,
            a second and milliseconds.

            Using new Date(), create a new date object with the current date and time.
            */

            /*
            The other ways to initialize dates allow for the creation of new date objects from the specified date and time.

            new Date(milliseconds)
            new Date(dateString)
            new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)
            
            Javascript dates are calculated in milliseconds from 01 January, 1970 00:00:00 Universal Time(UTC). One day contains
            86.400.000 millisecond.

            For example:
            */
            var d1 = new Date(86400000);
            document.write("<br/>" + d1);

            document.write("<br/>" + d3);

            /*
            Javascript counts months from 0 to 11. January is 0, and December is 11. Date objects are static, rather than dynamic.

            Date Methods
            When a Date object is created, a number of methods make it possible to perform operations on it.
