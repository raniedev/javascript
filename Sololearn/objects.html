            [INTRODUCING OBJECTS]
            Javascript Objects
            
            Javascript variables are containers for data values. Objects are variable too, but they can contain many values.
            Think of an object as a list of values that are written as name:value pairs, with the names and the values separated
            by colons.
            
            Example:
            */
            var person = {
                name: 'John Titor', age: 43, favColor: 'Green', height: 183
            }; //Javascript objects are containers for named values.
            

            /*
            Object Propertiers
                You can access object properties in two ways.
                objectName.propertyName
                        OR
                objectName['propertyName']
            */
            document.write("Name: " + person.name + ", Age: " + person['age']);

            //Javascript's built-in lenght property is used to count the number of characters in a property or string.
            document.write("<br/>" + person.name.length);

            /*
            Object Methods
                An object method is a property that contains a function definition. Use the following syntax to access an object method.
                    objectName.methodName();
            
                As you already know, document.write() outputs data. The write() function is actually a method of the document object.
                    document.write("This is some text");
                
                Methods are functions that are stored as object properties.

            
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            [CREATING THE OWN OBJECTS]
            The object constructor

            In the previous lesson, we created an object using the object literal(or initializer) syntax.
            var person = {
                name: 'John Titor', age: 43, favColor: 'Green', height: 183
            };
            
            This allows you to create only a single object.
            Sometimes, we need to set an "object type" that can be used to create a number of objects of a single type. The standard way 
            to create an "object type" is to use an object constructor function.
            */
            function person2(name, age, color){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.color = color;
            }
            
            /*
            The above function(person) is an object constructor, which takes parameters and assigns them to the object properties.
            
            The this keyword refers to the current object. Note that this is not a variable. It is a keyword, and its value cannot be changed.
            
            [CREATING OBJECTS]
            Once you have an object constructor, you can use the new keyword to create new objects of the same type.
            */

            var p1 = new person2('Anna', 28, 'ピンク');
            document.write("<br/>" + p1.color);

            /*
            [OBJECT INITIALIZATION]
            Use the object literal or initializer syntax to create single objects.
            */
            var John = {name: 'John', age: 25};
            var James = {name: 'James', age: 21};

            /*
            Using Object Initializers
                Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines.

                Not matter how the object is created, the syntax for accessing the properties and methods does not change.
            */
            var Anna = {
                name: 'Anna',
                age: 28
            };

            /*
            [ADDING METHODS]
            Methods
                Methods are functions that are stored as object properties.
                Use the following syntax to create an object method:
                    methodName : function(){code lines}

                Access an object method using the following syntax:
                    objectName.methodName();

            A method is a function, belonging to an object. It can be referenced using the this keyword. The this keyword is used
            as a referenced to the current object, meaning that you can access the objects properties and methods using it.

            Defining methods is done inside the constructor function.
            For example:
            */
            function person3(name, age){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.changeName = function(name){
                    this.name = name;
                }
            }
            
            var p2 = new person3("Yuna", 34);
            document.write("<br/>Current name: " + p2.name);
            p2.changeName("Yunna"); 
            document.write("<br/>Name changed: " + p2.name);

            /*In the example above, we have defined a method named changeName for our person, which is a  function, that takes
            a parameter name and assigns it to the name property of the object.
            this.name refers to the name preperty of the object.
            
            The changeName method changes the object's name property to its argument.
            
            Methods
            
            You can also define the function outside of the constructor function and associate it with the object.
            */

            function person4(name, age){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.yearOfBirth = bornYear;
            }
            
            function bornYear(){
                return 2018 - this.age;
            }

            var p2 = new person4("Ranie", 27);

            document.write("<br/>A person with " + p2.age + " years old, born in " + p2.yearOfBirth() + " age."); //call the method by the property name you specified in the constructor function, rather than the function name.

            /*As you can see, we have assigned the object's yearOfBirth property to the bornYear function. The this keyword is used
            to access the age property of the object, which is going to call the method.
            
            Note that it's not necessary to write the function's parentheses when assigning it to an object.*/
