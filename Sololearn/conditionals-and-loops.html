            /*The if statement
            
            Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions based on
            different conditions.
            You can do this by using conditional statements in your code.
            
            Use if to specify a block of code that will be executed if a special condition is true*/
            if(5 > 2){
                document.write("This text appears because the if statement condition is true.");
            }
            /*
            if(3 < 1){
                document.write("Text"); // this block is skipped
            }
            
            As the condition evaluates to false, the alert statement is skipped and the program continues
            with the line after the if statement's closing curly brace.

            Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If, IF or iF) will generate an error.
            
            
            The else statement
            Use the else statement to specify a block of code that will execute if the condition is false.
            if(expression){
                //executed if condition is true
            }else{
                //executed if condition is false
            }
            */
            if(3 < 1){
                document.write("<br/>True instruction");
            }else{
                document.write("<br/>False instruction");
            }
            
            /*You can use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
            
            if(expression 1){

            }else if(expression 2){

            }else if(expression N){

            }else{

            }
            

            The Switch Statement
            In cases when you need to test for multiple conditions, writing if else statements for each
            condition might not be the best solution. The switch statement is used to perform different
            actions based on different conditions.

            Syntax:
                Switch(expression){
                    case x:
                        statements;
                        break;
                    case y:
                        statements;
                        break;
                    default:
                        statements;
                }
            
            The switch statement is evaluated once. The value of the expression is compared with the values of
            each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

            You can achieve the same result with multiple if...else statements, but the switch statement is more
            effective in such situations.
            */
            var day = 3;
            switch(day){
                case 1:
                    document.write("<br/>Today's Sunday");
                    break;
                case 2:
                    document.write("<br/>Today's Monday");
                    break;
                case 3:
                    document.write("<br/>Today's Tuesday");
                    break;
                default:
                    document.write("<br/>I don't know day.");
            } //You can have as many case statements as needed

            /*
            The Break Statement
            - Whe Javacript code reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the
            execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
            - Usually, a break should be put in each case statement.
            
            The Default Key word
            - The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match
            - The default block can be omitted, if there is no need to handle the case when no match is found.
            
            
            Loops
                Loops can be execute a block of code a number of times. They are handy in cases in which you want to run
            the same code repeatedly, adding a different value each time.
                Javascript has three types of loops: 'for', 'while', and 'do while'.
                The 'for' loop is commonly used when creating a loop.
            
            The syntax:
                for(statement 1; statement 2; statement 3){
                    code block to be executed
                }
            
            Statement 1: is executed before the loop(the code block) stars.
            Statement 2: defines the condition for running the loop(the code block).
            Statement 3: is executed each time after loop(the code block) has been executed.

            As you can see, the classic for loop has three components, or statements.
            */
            document.write("<br/>The example below creates a for loop that prints numbers 1 through 5.<br/>");
            for(loopX = 1; loopX <= 5; loopX++){
                document.write(loopX + "<br/>");
            }
            
            /*
            In this example, Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts(var loopX = 1).
            Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run(I must be less than or equal to 5).
            Statement 3 increases a value(loopX++)


            Statement 1 is optional, and can be omitted, if your values are set before the loop stars.

                document.write("<br/>" + loopY);
            }

            //Also, you can initiate more than one value in statement 1, using commas to separate them.
            document.write("<br/><br/>Initiating more than one value in the first statement.");
            for(loopZ = 1, text = ""; loopZ<=7; loopZ++){
                text += loopZ;
                document.write("<br/>" + loopZ);
            }
            document.write("<br/>All loop numbers attributed in a string: " + text);

            /*
            The for loop

                If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end.
            Statement 2 is also optional.
                If you ommit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise, the loop will never end.
            
            Statement 3: is used to change the initial variable. It can do anything, incluing negative increment(i--),
            positive increment(i = i + 15), or anything else.
                Statement 3 is also optional, and it can be omitted if you increment your values inside the loop.

                    code block
                }

            The do...while loop

            The do...while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition
            is true, and then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

            Syntax:
                do{
                    code block
                }while(condition); // Note the semicolon used at the end of the do...while loop.

                number_b += 2;
