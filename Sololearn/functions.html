            /*User-Defined Function
            Javascript functions

            A javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. The main advantages
            of using functions. Code reuse: Define the code once, and use it many times. Use the same code many
            times with different arguments, to produce different results.
            
            A Javascript function is executed when "something" invokes, or calls, it.
            
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Defining a function

            To define a Javascript function, use the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by a set of 
            parantheses().

            The code to be executed by the function is placed inside curly brackets {}.


            Functions names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

            */
            function functionName(){
                //code to be executed
            }
            
            /*
            Calling a function
            
            To execute the function, you need to call it.
            To call a function, start with the name of the function, then follow it with the arguments in parentheses.

            Example:*/
            function myFunction(){
                document.write("Calling a function...");
            }

            myFunction(); //Alerts "Calling a function!"
            /*
            Always remember to end the statement with a semicolon after calling the function.
            Once the function is defined, Javascript allows you to call it as many times as you want to.

            
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            
            Function Parameters
            
            Function can take parameters. function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.

            Syntax:*/
            function name(param1, param2, param3){
                //some code
            }

            /*As with variables, parameters should be given names, which are separated by commas within the parentheses.
            
            Using parameters
            After defining the parameters, you can use them inside the function.*/
            function sayHello(name){
                document.write("<br/>Hi, " + name + "!");
            }
            sayHello("Helen");

            /*
            This function takes in one parameter, which is called name. When calling the function, provide the parameter's
            value(argument) inside the parentheses.

            Function arguments are the real values passed to(and received by) the function.
            
            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            [USING MULTIPLE PARAMETERS WITH FUNCTIONS]

            Multiple Parameters
            You can define multiple parameters for a function by comma-separating them.
            */
            function example(name, age){
                document.write("<br/>My name is " + name + " and I've " + age + " years old.");
            }
            example("Aline", "51");

            /*
            Multiple Parameters
            After defining the function, you can call it as many times as needed. Javascript functions do not check
            the number of arguments received.

            If a function is called with missing arguments(fewer than declared), the missing values are set to undefined,
            which indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.

            [THE RETURN STATEMENT]
            Function Return
                A function can have an optional return statement. It's used to return a value from the function. This statement
                is useful when making calculations that require a result.
            
            When Javascript reaches a return statement, the function stops executing.
            

            Use the return statement to return a value.
            For example, let's calculate the product of two numbers, and return the result.
            */
            function myProduct(number_a, number_b){
                return number_a * number_b;
            }
            document.write("<br/>The product is: " + myProduct(5, 6));
            /*If you don't return anything from a function, it'll return undefined.
            
            [ALERT, PROMPT, CONFIRM]
            The alert box
                Javascript offers three type of popup boxes, the Alert, Prompt and Confirm boxes.
            
            Alert Box
                An alert box is used when you want to ensure that information gets through to the user. When an alert
            box pops up, the user must click OK to proceed. The alert function takes a single parameter, which is the
            text displayed in the popup box.

            Example:
            */
            alert("Do you really want to leave this page?");

            /*To displayed line breaks within a popup box, use a backslash followed by the charaacter n.*/
            alert("Hello\nHow are you?"); // Be careful when using alert boxes, as the user can continue using the page only after clicking OK.

            /*
            [PROMPT BOX]
                A prompt box is often used to have the user input a value before entering a page. When a prompt box pops up,
            the user will have to click either OK or Cancel to proceed after entering the input value. If the user clicks OK,
            the box returns the input value. If the user clicks Cancel, the box returns null. 

            The prompt() method takes two parameters.
            - The first is the label, which you want to display the text box.
            - The second is a default string to display in the text box(optional).

            Example:
            */
            var user = prompt("Please enter your name: ");
            alert(user);

            /*
            [CONFIRM BOX]
                A confirm box is often used to have the user verify or accept something. When a confirm box pops up, the user
            must click either OK or Cancel to proceed. If the user clicks OK, the box returns true. If the user clicks Cancel,
            the box returns false.

            Example:
            */
            var result = confirm("Do you really want to leave this page?");
            if(result == true){
                alert("Thanks for visiting.");
            }else{
                alert("Thanks for staying with us.");
            }
