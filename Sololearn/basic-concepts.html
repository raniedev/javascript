            Naming rules
                - The first character MUST BE a letter, an underscore(_), or a dollar sign($). Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
                - Numbers are NOT ALLOWED as the first character.
                - Variable names CANNOT include a mathematical or logical operator in the name. For instance, 2*something or this+that;
                - Javascript names MUST NOT CONTAIN SPACES.
                - Hyphens are not allowed in Javascript. It's reserved for subtractions.
            Other rules
                - You MUST NOT use any SPECIAL SYMBOLS, like my#num, num%, etc.
                - Be sure that you do not use any the following Javascript reserved words

            Increment & Decrement
            Increment++
            The increment operator increments the numeric value of its operand by one. If placed before the operand, it returns
            the incremented value. If placed after the operand, it returns the original value and then increments the operand.

            Decrement--
            The decrement operator decrements the numeric value of its operand by one. If placed before the operand, it returns the
            decrement value. If placed after the operand, it returns the original value and then decrements the operand.
